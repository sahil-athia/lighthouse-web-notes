 ### Tips

 Try experimenting with comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc) , in the node REPL, 
 which you can launch using `node` command in terminal.

 Work on your code interactivly - this means in small pieces

 To figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` in the function, try outputting their values in terminal.

 ``` javascript
 function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
   console.log("hungry, is", hungry);
   console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
 }
